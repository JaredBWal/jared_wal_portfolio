I worked closely with two of my fellow ACM club members to create a content management system that would allow users to create tournaments for the game ‘osu!’. Users also have the ability to sign into their osu accounts and register for active tournaments. The tournament hosts are able to create tournaments for specific groups of players in osu, such as only allowing users of a certain rank range to register for the tournament.",

I worked with fellow club members to develop a cross-platform mobile application that can find the fastest path between any two buildings on our campus (Christopher Newport University). This project was developed with Python using the OpenStreetMap API and the Toga GUI toolkit. The reason for creating this application was because there was no Google pathing for our school at that time, and we wanted to make an app that could help new students and visitors get directions to campus buildings.",
