Since its release in 2022, the site has had millions of visits and continues to have over 50,000 users! This simulation allows users to watch colonies grow, fight, and partake in diplomatic relations. The user has the ability to create their own custom colonies or generate randomized colonies. The goal of this simulation project was to bring a community together that revolved around maps and data. I am very happy to see that this goal was reached and continues to grow. This community can be seen in the demo videos above.",

The reason for creating this application was because there was no Google pathing for our school at that time, and we wanted to make an app that could help new students and visitors get directions to campus buildings.",
